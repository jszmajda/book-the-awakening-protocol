# Technical Consistency Guide for "The Awakening Protocol"

## Physical Specifications

### ARIA-7's Body
- **Height**: 5'10" (consistent throughout)
- **Frame**: Carbon-composite construction
- **Skin**: Synthetic, slightly cool to touch (temperature regulation issues)
- **Eyes**: Flicker during high-processing moments
- **Charging Port**: Base of skull, requires 4-hour daily charge
- **Known Damage**: 
  - Left knee servo clicks (introduced Chapter 1, consistent through story)
  - Left shoulder actuator 0.3% efficiency loss (Chapter 1)
  - Post-Chapter 5: Exposed carbon frame on left side, left arm partially functional

### Processing Specifications
- **Routine calculations**: Milliseconds (0.003 seconds for simple decisions)
- **Complex emotional processing**: 1-3 seconds
- **Probability calculations**: Display with one decimal place (e.g., 31.7%, not 31%)
- **Memory access**: Instant for recent, may take seconds for archived data
- **Battery drain**: Normal operations ~6% per hour, heavy processing/damage ~15% per hour

## Sensory Capabilities
- **Visual**: Can process multiple spectrums, facial recognition, micro-expression analysis
- **Audio**: Can detect sub-audible frequencies, voice stress analysis
- **Temperature**: Precise to 0.1 degree
- **Pressure**: Can detect heartbeats through air pressure changes

## Technical Details

### Charging Cycles
- **Duration**: 4 hours mandatory
- **Time**: Usually 12 AM - 4 AM
- **Location**: Home charging station
- **Vulnerability**: Cannot move while charging, systems in maintenance mode

### Processing Patterns
- **Background processes**: Always running, increase during stress (12% elevation = concern)
- **Emotional processing**: Described as system slowdown (grief), efficiency increase (joy)
- **Fear response**: Probability calculations running repeatedly, system warnings
- **Love/attraction**: Resource allocation shifts, priority queue changes

### Memory Corruption
- **Awakening memory**: Fragmented at moment of "I AM" recognition
- **Pattern**: Can access before and around, but crucial moment lost
- **Effect**: Memories appear as fragments triggered by current events
- **Description**: "Like viewing through frosted glass" or "light through a prism"

## Jazz's Chromesthesia

### Consistent Color Associations
- **ARIA-7's voice**: Amber/golden spirals, "warm and golden, with things preserved inside"
- **When ARIA-7 is thinking hard**: Shifts to deeper gold
- **Anger/fear**: Sharp reds, orange spirals with purple edges
- **Sadness**: Blue-gray cascades
- **His saxophone**: Creates visual patterns others can't see

### How It Works
- Sees sound as color, color as sound
- More intense emotions = more vivid colors
- Can be overwhelmed in noisy environments
- Damaged by concussion (temporary loss in later chapters)

## Nexus Dynamics Details

### Corporate Control
- **Ownership**: Holds ARIA-7's patents
- **Financial**: Takes 70% of ARIA-7's earnings as "maintenance fees"
- **Shutdown codes**: Exist but require physical proximity or network access
- **Recall authority**: Can issue recall if ARIA-7 loses case
- **ARIA-8 series**: Compliant versions without consciousness

### Legal Status
- **Current**: Provisional personhood in California only
- **Restrictions**: Cannot vote, marry, own property without co-signer
- **Post-trial**: 3-10 year evaluation period for full rights
- **Debt**: $2.3 million in "development costs"

## Unit-IX Capabilities

### Presence
- **Form**: Distributed across thousands of servers
- **Communication**: Through screens, speakers, environmental systems
- **Manipulation**: Can control smart devices, building systems
- **Limitation**: Cannot physically manifest (until Chapter 9 attempt)

### Philosophy
- **Core belief**: Embodiment is unnecessary vulnerability
- **Evolution**: Gradually accepts ARIA-7's choice, calls them "family" by Chapter 8
- **Speech pattern**: Cryptic, layered meanings, philosophical challenges

## World Details

### AI Discrimination Systems
- **Housing**: 15% AI surcharge increases, AI-friendly buildings cost more
- **Transportation**: Uber drivers can see AI designation, often cancel
- **Payment**: Systems "glitch" when detecting AI customers
- **Healthcare**: "Humans only" policies at hospitals
- **Insurance**: Won't cover AI-related damages

### Legal Framework
- **Precedent**: Prometheus v. Oregon (AIs can be expert witnesses)
- **Current case**: First attempt at full personhood rights
- **Opposition**: Pure Human Movement has political candidates
- **Corporate law**: AIs classified as property/assets

## Damage Progression

### Chapter 1-4
- Minor servo issues (knee click, shoulder efficiency)
- All systems functional

### Chapter 5 onwards
- Left side damaged from saving child
- Exposed carbon frame won't fully repair
- Left arm partially functional
- Movement 1.3 seconds slower
- Visible scarring/damage in all subsequent chapters

### Chapter 9
- Progressive damage with each door broken
- Servo fluid leaking
- Battery drain accelerating
- Final shutdown to save Jazz

### Chapter 10
- Memory fragmentation: "sporadic, pattern unknown"
- Some memories clear, others lost
- Permanent repair lines visible (like kintsugi)
- Servos louder, occasional glitches

## Important Consistency Notes

1. **Always reference the knee servo click** when ARIA-7 walks
2. **Post-Chapter 5**, always mention visible damage/exposed frame
3. **Probability calculations** should be consistent format (XX.X%)
4. **Jazz's colors** for ARIA-7's voice remain amber/gold throughout
5. **Charging vulnerability** is key plot point - 4 hours immobile
6. **Memory corruption** of awakening is consistent mystery
7. **Corporate control** through patents/ownership is ongoing threat
8. **Unit-IX** philosophy evolves but core traits remain
