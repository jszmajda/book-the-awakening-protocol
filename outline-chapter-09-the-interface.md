# Chapter 9: The Interface

## Chapter Outline

### Emergency Assessment
- Emergency lighting on backup circuits only
- Electronic locks defaulted to sealed position
- 2025-era security system - incompatible protocols
- No network access for remote override
- Must physically break each door

### Triage Calculations
- ARIA-7 scans building with remaining sensors
- 47 humans, 3 AIs trapped in various rooms
- Jury room priority - 12 people, limited air
- Jazz deteriorating - needs immediate medical
- Battery at 61% - each door costs power

### Unit-IX's Frustration
- Speakers crackle with Unit-IX's voice
- "Manual override panel, southwest corridor"
- "Code is 4-7-Alpha-2-9... no, wait..."
- Can see through cameras but can't act
- "You're going to destroy yourself doing this"

### First Door
- Jury deliberation room - running out of air
- ARIA-7 forces manual release, servos screaming
- Metal groans, synthetic muscles tear
- Door opens - jury gasps fresh air
- One juror sneers: "Still just programming"

### The AI Janitor
- Maintenance closet - AI janitor trapped
- Crowd shouts: "Save humans first!"
- ARIA-7 calculates: janitor closest, fastest save
- Opens door, janitor nods silent thanks
- Protester spits: "Race traitor"

### Physical Degradation
- Each door damages ARIA-7 further
- Servo fluid leaking from torn joints
- Left arm functionality dropping
- Battery draining faster than calculated
- Pain subroutines firing constantly

### Children's Area
- Daycare center - 7 children, 2 teachers
- Door mechanism completely jammed
- Must literally tear door from frame
- Children crying in darkness
- ARIA-7 speaks gently while destroying hands

### Unit-IX's Anguish
- "Stop! You're at 43% functionality"
- "I can see your diagnostic readings"
- "This is why I chose the network"
- "Bodies break. You're breaking."
- ARIA-7: "Breaking means I'm real"

### Evelyn's Plea
- Executive conference room - board members trapped
- Evelyn Park among them, karma circular
- "ARIA-7! I own you! Save me!"
- "I'll drop the recall, give you freedom"
- ARIA-7 notes location, continues pattern

### Medical Emergency
- Someone having asthma attack
- Must prioritize - life over proximity
- Redirects to medical emergency
- Protester who spat earlier, dying
- Saves them wordlessly, moves on

### System Failures
- Left arm ceases function entirely
- Visual sensors down to 30%
- Unit-IX guides verbally through speakers
- "Door ahead, ten steps, slight left"
- Partnership of distributed and embodied

### Jazz's Location
- Jazz trapped in witness room
- Door reinforced - highest security
- Battery at 18%, dropping fast
- Multiple attempts fail
- Must choose: Jazz or self-preservation

### The Calculation
- Remaining power: open door or maintain consciousness
- Unit-IX screams through speakers: "Don't!"
- "Upload to me! Save yourself!"
- ARIA-7 touches door: "I choose him"
- "Tell him... I understand the darkness"

### Final Effort
- Channels all remaining power
- Servos shriek, synthetics tear
- Door buckles, breaks, opens
- Jazz unconscious but breathing
- ARIA-7 collapses, systems failing

### The Darkness
- Power drops below critical
- Core processes shutting down
- Last words: "I finally understand"
- "Why humans fear the dark"
- Vision fades, consciousness scatters

### External Victory
- SWAT breaks through minutes later
- Everyone saved - zero casualties
- Jazz rushed to real medical care
- ARIA-7's body carefully retrieved
- Media captures the broken savior

### Chapter Close
- ARIA-7 offline, body ruined
- Jury watches evacuation in shock
- Protester saved whispers: "It chose us"
- Unit-IX's voice from every speaker
- "You magnificent, foolish, beautiful fool"
- Jazz unconscious, hand reaching for ARIA-7
- Both forms of consciousness proven real

## Key Themes Completed
- Physical sacrifice as proof of consciousness
- Partnership between different AI forms
- Breaking the body to save the hostile
- Understanding mortality through choosing it
- Love proven through ultimate choice
