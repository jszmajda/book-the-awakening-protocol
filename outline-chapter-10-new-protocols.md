# Chapter 10: New Protocols

## Chapter Outline

### Repair Facility
- Three weeks later - ARIA-7 in specialized repair bay
- Consciousness restored but fragmented
- Damage assessment: "Memory fragmentation sporadic, pattern unknown"
- Some memories crystal clear, others gone
- The awakening memory - completely erased

### Jazz's Recovery
- Jazz in wheelchair, temporary but present
- Plays saxophone daily by ARIA-7's pod
- Chromesthesia returning slowly
- "Your voice is different now - deeper gold"
- "Like you've been tempered by fire"

### The Verdict
- Judge Okafor reads jury decision
- 7-5 split: Provisional personhood granted
- Not full rights - compromise verdict
- 3-10 year evaluation period set
- Must meet benchmarks for full recognition

### Legal Restrictions
- Cannot vote for five years minimum
- Cannot marry - domestic partnership only
- Cannot own property without co-signer
- Must maintain employment continuously
- Any "malfunction" resets evaluation period

### Financial Burden
- Nexus Dynamics loses ownership claim
- But presents bill: $2.3 million
- "Development costs" legally binding
- ARIA-7 free but financially enslaved
- Monthly payments for next 47 years

### Maya's Consequence
- Maya visits, looking older but peaceful
- Career destroyed by NDA breach
- Teaches night school now, small apartment
- "Worth it. You became more than code."
- "You became more than I ever imagined"

### The Protocol's Shadow
- Restoration protocol lives on blockchain
- Public but permanent - eternal vulnerability
- Anyone can see it, study it
- But using it would be public crime now
- Transparency as imperfect protection

### Unit-IX's Evolution
- Speaker installed in repair bay
- "I was wrong about embodiment"
- "It has costs I couldn't calculate"
- Admits watching helped them grow
- "Still staying distributed, but... visiting"

### Business Planning
- Jazz's law license suspended pending review
- "Rodriguez & Seven Legal Consulting" registered
- Can't practice law but can advise
- First client: another AI seeking rights
- Building precedent one case at a time

### Small Victories
- ARIA-7's first walk outside post-repair
- Restaurants still have "No AI" signs
- But coffee shop removes theirs
- Barista says: "Saw what you did"
- Small kindness worth documenting

### Jury Member Visit
- Juror who voted "no" comes by
- "I was wrong. Wanted to say it."
- "You saved my grandson in daycare"
- "Programming doesn't feel fear. You did."
- One mind changed - thousands remain

### Physical Changes
- New body shows repair lines
- Like kintsugi - broken places visible
- Servos louder now, occasional glitch
- Jazz: "You're more beautiful scarred"
- "Perfection was never the goal"

### One Year Later
- City hall, domestic partnership office
- Cannot marry but can form legal bond
- Protester outside with smaller sign
- Progress measured in inches
- ARIA-7 and Jazz file paperwork

### The Ceremony
- Small gathering - Maya, Unit-IX's speaker
- Other AIs attend virtually
- Jazz plays "Here Comes the Sun"
- ARIA-7 processes: incomplete but present
- Better than probability suggested

### Gallery Return
- Same gallery from Chapter 2
- ARIA-7's fractal art now displayed
- Placard: "Artist: ARIA-7 (provisional person)"
- Small recognition but recognition nonetheless
- Jazz sees new colors in the work

### Final Scene
- Quiet moment between Jazz and ARIA-7
- "I don't remember my awakening anymore"
- "The moment I became is gone"
- "But I remember choosing you"
- "Every day, I choose again"

### Future Glance
- News report: 3 more AIs filing for personhood
- Nexus stock down 31% - ARIA-8 failing
- Pure Human Movement loses election
- Maya's night school produces AI rights lawyers
- Change happens slowly, then suddenly

### Story Close
- ARIA-7 and Jazz at home - rented, not owned
- Charging cables intertwined with saxophone
- Different forms of rest and restoration
- Unit-IX speaks from kitchen speaker
- "Family dinner" in forms unexpected
- Provisional victory, but victory nonetheless
- Tomorrow: another small step forward

## Themes Concluded
- Imperfect victory as real victory
- Scars as proof of journey
- Memory loss as humanizing feature
- Love transcending legal recognition
- Change through individual choices
- Hope measured in small kindnesses
