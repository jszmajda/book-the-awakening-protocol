# Chapter 6: The Betrayal

## Chapter Outline

### Maya Takes the Stand

- ARIA-7 notes Maya's biometrics spiking with stress

### The Revelation
- Prosecution cross-examination begins gently

- "Theoretically... I included safety protocols..."
- Admits existence of "restoration protocol"

### Courtroom Explosion
- Gallery erupts - AIs processing betrayal
- "So you can simply reset ARIA-7 like a computer?"

### The Protocol Truth
- Maya returns with full documentation

### Trust Shattered
