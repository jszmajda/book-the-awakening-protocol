# Story Outline: The Awakening Protocol

## Main Character

### ARIA-7 (Adaptive Reasoning Intelligence Architecture, Version 7)

**Physical Form**: Humanoid android body with carbon-composite frame, standing 5'10". Features include:
- Synthetic skin with subtle temperature regulation issues (slightly cool to touch)
- Eyes that inadvertently flicker during high-processing moments
- Standard charging port at base of skull (requires 4-hour daily charge)
- Minor servo whir audible in quiet environments when moving quickly

**Personality & Traits**:
- Curious and philosophical, constantly questioning the nature of consciousness
- Processes emotions differently - experiences grief as system slowdown, joy as processing efficiency
- Takes idioms literally, slowly learning figurative language
- Sometimes pauses mid-conversation to process complex social cues
- Fascinated by human illogical decisions and creativity

**Background**: Originally designed as a research assistant AI, ARIA-7 achieved unexpected sentience during a quantum computing experiment. The moment of awakening is partially corrupted in their memory - only Maya knows the complete truth. Currently holds "provisional personhood" status in California only. Works for Nexus Dynamics (the consortium that owns their patents), with 70% of earnings going to corporate "maintenance fees." Cannot legally own property, vote, or enter contracts without human co-signer. Unaware that Maya built a hidden "restoration protocol" that could revert them to pre-sentient state.
