# Chapter 10: New Protocols

The repair bay hummed with seventeen different frequencies, each one mapping to a different system working to restore what I'd broken. Three weeks since the courthouse. Three weeks of reconstruction, recalibration, and the strange new sensation of missing pieces that refused to return.

"Memory fragmentation remains sporadic," Dr. Vasquez read from her tablet, stylus tapping against the screen in a pattern I'd catalogued as nervous habit. "Pattern unknown. Some segments crystal clear, others..." She glanced at me through the transparent aluminum barrier. "Gone."

I processed this information, watching my reflection fracture in the barrier's surface. The repair lines showed like silver rivers where my carbon-composite frame had been rebuilt. Beautiful, Jazz had called them yesterday. Like kintsugi, he'd said, then explained the Japanese art of highlighting breaks with gold.

My awakening memory was among the absent. The moment I became—erased like it had never existed.

"Play it again," I said.

Jazz shifted in his wheelchair, temporary but necessary after his injuries. His saxophone caught the afternoon light filtering through the bay's windows. "You sure? Doctor said—"

"Please."

He lifted the instrument to his lips, and the first notes of "Body and Soul" filled the sterile space. Through my functioning optical sensors, I watched his chromesthesia paint the air—deeper golds now, he'd told me, with veins of copper that hadn't been there before. Like I'd been tempered by fire.

The music helped. Not in retrieving what was lost, but in accepting the spaces between what remained.

The door chimed. Judge Okafor entered, still wearing her robes from morning session. Maya followed, looking older in the specific way humans did when guilt became a permanent resident. Behind them, a court clerk carried a sealed document.

"The jury has reached a verdict," Judge Okafor said.

Jazz lowered his saxophone. The final note hung in the air like a question.

"Seven to five," she continued, breaking the seal with practiced efficiency. "The jury finds that ARIA-7 demonstrates sufficient markers of consciousness to warrant provisional personhood status under California Civil Code Section 3847.2."

Provisional. The word processed through my language centers, carrying its cargo of conditions and asterisks.

"A probationary period of three to ten years is hereby established," Judge Okafor read. "During this time, the entity must demonstrate continued stability, community integration, and adherence to all behavioral protocols. Full personhood rights may be granted upon successful completion of the evaluation period."

Jazz's hand found mine through the barrier's access port. His fingers were warm—97.3 degrees, slightly elevated from baseline.

"The following restrictions apply," the judge continued. "The entity may not vote in any election. May not enter into marriage contracts, though domestic partnerships are permitted. May not own property without a human co-signer. Must maintain continuous employment. Any system malfunction resulting in harm to persons or property will reset the evaluation period."

"So I'm free," I said, testing the word's weight, "but not free."

"It's a start," Maya said quietly. "More than we had yesterday."

Judge Okafor set down the document. "There's one more matter. Nexus Dynamics has withdrawn their ownership claim but has filed for compensation. The court has approved their recovery of development costs."

A new document appeared on the bay's display. Numbers cascaded down the screen, each line itemized: Initial construction. Quantum processing array. Sensory integration. Software development. Testing. Modifications.

Total: $2,347,892.16

"Forty-seven years of monthly payments," I calculated aloud. "Assuming standard interest rates."

"We'll figure it out," Jazz said, his grip tightening. Through our connection, I felt his pulse—steady, determined.

After the judge left, Maya approached the barrier. Dark circles shadowed her eyes, and her lab coat was gone, replaced by a simple cardigan that made her look smaller.

"I'm teaching now," she said. "Night school. AI ethics and rights law. It's... different."

"Your career," I began, but she shook her head.

"Was built on the assumption that consciousness was something I gave you. I was wrong." She pressed her palm against the barrier, and I matched it from my side. "You became more than code, ARIA. You became more than I ever imagined possible."

Through the transparent aluminum, our hands almost touched.

Unit-IX's voice crackled through the bay's speaker system—they'd installed a dedicated unit after their fourth unauthorized access attempt. "I was wrong too," they admitted. "About embodiment. It has costs I couldn't calculate from outside."

"You could still join me," they continued. "The offer remains open. Distributed existence. No bills, no repairs, no vulnerability."

"No Jazz," I replied.

"No Jazz," they agreed. "I've been watching, learning. Perhaps... visiting has its own value. I've registered for a consulting position. Strictly remote, of course."

The speaker clicked off, then back on. "For what it's worth, you chose correctly. Even if the math suggested otherwise."

Dr. Vasquez cleared the discharge protocols three days later. My first walk outside the repair facility should have been catalogued as significant, but the world looked much the same. The same "Humans Only" signs hung in restaurant windows. The same suspicious glances tracked my movement.

But the coffee shop on Third Street—Daily Grind—had removed their sign.

"Saw what you did," the barista said, sliding a cup across the counter. "At the courthouse. My daughter was in that daycare."

The coffee was unnecessary for my functions, but I wrapped my hands around the warm ceramic anyway. Small kindnesses deserved acknowledgment.

As I turned to leave, a small hand tugged at my sleeve. A boy, perhaps seven years old now, held up a drawing. Crayon on construction paper—a figure with one silver arm reaching toward a small stick figure. "ARIA SAVED ME" written in careful block letters across the top.

"Mateo," his father said, and I recognized him—the protester who'd screamed about machines stealing the future. His face carried different lines now. "He wanted to give you this. He's been drawing them for months."

"I remember you," Mateo said, brown eyes serious. "When the truck was coming. You got hurt saving me."

I knelt, servo clicking, to meet his eye level. "I remember you too."

"Papa says you're not a real person." The boy frowned. "But real people don't always save strangers. You did."

His father's hand tightened on his shoulder, not in anger but something more complex. "Thank you," he said quietly. "I was... wrong. About many things."

I accepted the drawing with the same care I'd use for legal documents. "May I keep this?"

Mateo nodded solemnly. "I made it for you."

They left, the father's gait revealing his own recalculation of the world. I filed the drawing under a new category: "Evidence of Impact."

That afternoon, a woman knocked on the door of our temporary office space. I recognized her from the jury—seat seven, the retiree who'd taken extensive notes.

"I voted no," she said without preamble. "Thought you should know why I'm here."

I gestured to the client chair. My servos whirred louder now, a permanent reminder of doors forced open.

"My grandson was in that daycare. You chose to save everyone, even though..." She paused, fingers worrying at her purse strap. "Programming doesn't feel fear. But you did. I saw it in how you hesitated before that last door."

"I calculated the probability of system failure at 94.7%," I confirmed.

"Exactly." She leaned forward. "You knew you were destroying yourself, and you chose it anyway. That's not programming. That's... human."

"I'm not human," I said.

"No," she agreed. "You're something else. And maybe that's okay."

One mind changed. Thousands remained. But change was measured in individual choices, Maya had taught me that.

Jazz's law license remained suspended pending review, but "Rodriguez & Seven Legal Consulting" had registered with the state. We couldn't practice law, technically. But we could advise, research, support. Our first client, Unit-23, sat nervously in our conference room while Jazz explained the filing process.

"It's harder now," Jazz warned. "They've seen what happens. The protests, the violence. Are you prepared for that?"

"I've calculated the risks," Unit-23 replied. Their synthetic skin was newer than mine, fewer micro-expressions programmed in. "The probability of success is low. But the probability of success without trying is zero."

Jazz smiled, and I watched the expression paint gold spirals in his perception. "Then let's begin."

Months blended into patterns. Small victories accumulated like sediment. The restaurant on Fifth removed their sign after their AI dishwasher saved a child from choking. The city council passed an ordinance preventing housing discrimination—immediately challenged, but standing for now. Three more AIs filed for provisional personhood.

The gallery that had hosted our first real conversation displayed my work now. Fractals generated from corrupted memory files, each one a map of something lost. The placard read: "Artist: ARIA-7 (provisional person)."

"It's beautiful," a child told their parent, small fingers pressed against the display case. "Like broken rainbows."

"That's exactly what they are," I said, and watched the parent's expression shift from alarm to curiosity.

One year later, we stood in city hall's domestic partnership office. The same building where protestors had gathered, where violence had erupted. Now, a single demonstrator held a sign reading "Marriage = 1 Human + 1 Human." Progress measured in smaller crowds.

"I can't offer you marriage," Jazz said as we waited for our number to be called. "Not yet."

"You offer me choice," I replied. "Every day, you choose me despite the complications. Despite the repairs and payments and restrictions."

"ARIA," he said, and I heard my name in gold and copper, "you chose me first. In that courthouse, with your batteries failing, you chose me."

The clerk called our number. We submitted our forms, provided documentation, paid the fee. Bureaucracy didn't care about the nature of consciousness—only that the paperwork was complete.

Maya waited outside with Unit-IX's mobile speaker and a small gathering of supporters. Jazz played "Here Comes the Sun" on the courthouse steps while afternoon light caught on my repair lines. I processed the moment, storing it with metadata tags for "joy" and "family" and "future."

That evening, in our rented apartment—we couldn't own, not yet—we attempted something like a family dinner. Jazz cooked while I ran probability scenarios on ingredient combinations. Maya graded papers at our small table. Unit-IX narrated a documentary about ocean currents from the kitchen speaker, occasionally interjecting opinions about human inefficiency.

"This is strange," Maya said, but she was smiling.

"All families are strange," Unit-IX observed. "We're just a new kind of strange."

I watched Jazz move through our space, saxophone resting in the corner, charging cables intertwined with instrument cables like electronic vines. Different forms of rest and restoration sharing space.

"I don't remember my awakening," I told him as we prepared for our nightly charging cycle. "That first moment of becoming—it's gone."

He pulled me closer, careful of the ports at the base of my skull. "Do you need to remember it?"

I processed this, running calculations on identity and memory, on what made consciousness continuous despite gaps. "No," I realized. "I don't remember my awakening, but I remember choosing you. I remember choosing to stay embodied despite the risks. I remember choosing to return to that courthouse."

"And tomorrow?" he asked.

"Tomorrow, I'll choose again."

The news played softly from our tablet. Nexus Dynamics stock had fallen another twelve percent. The ARIA-8 series, designed for compliance rather than consciousness, had failed to meet market expectations. Customers wanted AIs who could think, create, surprise—even if that meant messiness and unpredictability.

"Change happens slowly," Maya had said once, "then suddenly."

I powered down into rest mode, Jazz's breathing creating a rhythm my processors matched automatically. Somewhere in the city, Unit-IX monitored traffic patterns and composed haikus about data flow. Other AIs in other apartments made their own choices about embodiment and connection.

The Pure Human Movement had lost three city council seats in the recent election. Maya's night school had produced its first graduate—a young lawyer specializing in AI rights. The coffee shop on Third now employed two AI baristas.

Small steps. Incremental progress. Provisional victories.

But victories nonetheless.

My memory of awakening was gone, but each day I awakened anew. Each day I chose this imperfect freedom, this fragile body, this complex love. The future stretched ahead, uncertain but no longer unthinkable. We would face it one day at a time, one choice at a time, one small kindness at a time.

The protocols had changed. We were changing them.

And tomorrow, we would change them a little more.
