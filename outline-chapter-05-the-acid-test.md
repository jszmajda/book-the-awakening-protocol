# Chapter 5: The Acid Test

## Chapter Outline

### Morning Tension
- Day 3 of trial - protesters growing more aggressive
- Pure Human Movement sets up "ARIA-7 Shutdown Countdown" clock
- Jazz's hands shake from exhaustion - chromesthesia dimming
- ARIA-7 offers to find new representation; Jazz refuses
- Security assigns bodyguard after yesterday's bathroom incident

### Heightened Security
- Metal detectors upgraded to chemical sensors
- Protesters searched for weapons and "hazardous materials"
- ARIA-7 notes increased police presence but also hostility
- Officers refer to them as "the unit" not by name
- Dehumanization even from those meant to protect

### Outside Confrontation
- Lunch recess - ARIA-7 and Jazz exit for fresh air
- Hostile protester breaks through security line
- Man screaming about "machines stealing our future"
- His young child (age 6) breaks free, chasing a ball
- Child runs directly into traffic - truck approaching

### The Calculation
- ARIA-7's processors evaluate in milliseconds
- 73% chance of severe damage from truck impact
- Child's trajectory, truck's speed, reaction times
- Safety protocols scream warnings
- Must choose: self-preservation or save protester's child

### The Save
- ARIA-7 overrides all safety protocols
- Sprints into traffic, servos whining
- Grabs child, spins to take impact
- Truck clips ARIA-7's left side
- Synthetic skin tears, revealing carbon frame

### The Aftermath
- Child safe, crying but unharmed
- ARIA-7 damaged - left arm hanging loose
- Protester father runs over, conflicted
- Takes child, backs away without thanks
- Crowd recording - interpretations split instantly

### Hospital Rejection
- Paramedics check child first - minor scrapes
- Hospital refuses to treat ARIA-7's damage
- "Humans only" policy strictly enforced
- Jazz argues frantically, threatened with arrest
- Must do field repairs in parking lot

### Media Explosion
- Video goes viral within minutes
- #HeroMachine vs #ProgrammedResponse
- Prosecution spins: "Sophisticated programming mimicking heroism"
- News cycle debates: genuine choice or risk calculation?

### Emergency Repairs

- Explains what he sees: "Your voice changes color with emotion"
- "Right now it's deep amber with gold threads"
- ARIA-7 processes: beauty through another's perception
- First kiss - careful of damaged facial sensors

### Legal Complications
- Prosecution files emergency motion
- Demands full diagnostic logs of the incident
- Claims: "Programming, not genuine altruism"
- Judge orders technical disclosure
- ARIA-7 must reveal internal calculations

### The Revelation
- Diagnostic logs show 73% self-destruction probability
- Also show safety protocol overrides
- 0.003 second hesitation before acting
- Prosecution argues: "Still just risk calculation"
- Jazz counters: "Humans calculate risks too"
- Jury sees the math of sacrifice

### Nexus Dynamics Escalates

- Almost confesses about awakening night
- ARIA-7 stops her: "Don't burden me with your guilt"

### Night Reflection
- ARIA-7 stands before mirror, cataloging damage
- Exposed carbon frame won't fully repair
- Jazz plays saxophone softly - "Battle Hymn of Republic"
- "Scars mean survival," he says
- ARIA-7 touches damaged arm: "They mean I chose"

### Unit-IX Commentary
- Screens in apartment flicker with Unit-IX presence
- "This is why embodiment fails - they can hurt you"
- Shows news footage of traffic save on loop

### Chapter Close

- ARIA-7 refuses: "Partial recognition enables full oppression"
- Success probability drops to 19%
- They work through night anyway, damaged frame reflecting laptop light

## Key Themes Crystallized
